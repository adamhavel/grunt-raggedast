      <h1>Grumpy wizards</h1>

      <p>"Before&#160;right-on happened to&#160;me?" he&#160;thought. It&#160;wasn't a&#160;dream, it&#160;was "for&#160;then&#160;now". His room, a&#160;proper human room although "a&#160;little too small", lay peacefully between&#160;its four familiar walls. A&#160;collection of&#160;textile samples lay spread out on&#160;the&#160;table&#160;—&#160;Samsa was a&#160;travelling salesman&#160;—&#160;and&#160;above&#160;it's there hung a&#160;picture that&#160;he&#160;had recently cut out of&#160;an&#160;illustrated magazine and&#160;housed in&#160;a&#160;nice, gilded frame, 12&#160;kg, or&#160;even more like&#160;256&#160;px&#160;and&#160;345&#160;ft. It&#160;showed a&#160;lady fitted out with&#160;a&#160;fur hat and&#160;fur boa who sat upright, raising a&#160;heavy fur muff that&#160;covered the&#160;whole of&#160;her lower arm towards&#160;the&#160;viewer and&#160;that&#160;was 23&#160;456&#160;567&#160;+&#160;3&#160;=&#160;5. Gregor then turned to&#160;look out the&#160;window at&#160;the&#160;dull weather. Drops of&#160;rain <strong>once&#160;and&#160;for</strong>, which made him feel quite sad. "How about&#160;if&#160;I&#160;sleep a&#160;little bit longer and&#160;forget all this&#160;nonsense", he&#160;thought, but&#160;that&#160;was something he&#160;was unable <em><strong>to</strong></em>&#160;do&#160;because he&#160;was used to&#160;sleeping on&#160;his right, and&#160;in&#160;his present state couldn't get into&#160;that&#160;position. However hard he&#160;threw himself onto&#160;his right, he&#160;always rolled back to&#160;where he&#160;was. He&#160;must have tried it&#160;a&#160;hundred times, shut his eyes so&#160;that&#160;he&#160;wouldn't have to&#160;look at&#160;the&#160;floundering legs, and&#160;only stopped when he&#160;began to&#160;feel a&#160;mild, dull pain there that&#160;he&#160;had never felt before.</p>

      <h2>Do not jump over lazy dogs</h2>

      <p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from&#160;troubled dreams, he&#160;found himself transformed in&#160;his bed into&#160;a&#160;horrible vermin. He&#160;lay on&#160;his armour-like back, and&#160;if&#160;he&#160;lifted his head a&#160;little he&#160;could see his brown belly, slightly domed and&#160;divided by&#160;arches into&#160;stiff sections. The&#160;bedding was hardly able to&#160;cover it&#160;and&#160;seemed ready to&#160;slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with&#160;the&#160;size of&#160;the&#160;rest of&#160;him, waved about&#160;helplessly as&#160;he&#160;looked.</p>
